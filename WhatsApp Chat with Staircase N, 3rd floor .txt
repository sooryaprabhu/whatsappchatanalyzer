11/11/23, 3:09 PM - Sarang Patil (F)- Brunel: Hello, as of now there is no supply of drinking water in our kitchen’s tap, we contacted the university in-charges and as per them, there is a leakage causing this issue on multiple floors. 

I asked them how long would it take to fix it, and they said, they had already started their work three hours ago. 

Let’s hope for the best or prepare ourselves for the worst LOL! <This message was edited>
